Earth’s accelerating warming is driven primarily by oceanic heat accumulation: the ocean absorbs over 90% of anthropogenic heat and determines the planet’s climate trajectory. Current mitigation focuses almost exclusively on emission reductions and untested geoengineering. This paper proposes a dual-layer, distributed, self-powered oceanic
